# Tailor S7 1200/1500 PLC for Effective ISOTCP Plugin Use

When interfacing with Siemens S7 1200/1500 PLC using the Siemens S7 ISOTCP plugin, certain modifications are required in the Siemens software (TIA16) settings:

* The **optimized block access** must be turned off.
* The **access level** must be **full** and the **connection mechanism** must allow GET/PUT.

This section uses TIA Portal V16 to demonstrate the setting. 

## Connection to PLC

First, the connection device settings should be made, as shown in the image below.
